# Real-Time Object Detection with YOLOv5 and Streamlit
This repository contains a Python application that performs real-time object detection using the YOLOv5 model and displays the results using Streamlit. The application provides three options for object detection: uploading an image, using a webcam for live detection, and uploading a video for detection.
